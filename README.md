# Aho

Demonstration of Aho-Corasick in Python, showing how it is a generalisation of Knuth-Morris-Pratt.

Created as an exercise for mentoring a group project for final year university students. The project involves fuzzy string matching and therefore an understanding of fundamental string algorithms is useful.

The implementation in the code may not be perfectly efficient (e.g. substring commands are used for printing/debugging) - but the fundamental algorithm is correct.

The exercise for the reader is to extend the algorithm to add dictionary links, which allow for matching patterns that are substrings of other patterns.
